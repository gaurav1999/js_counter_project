# About 

This is a simple JS app for learning how to manipulate HTML and create a counter functionality.
It also helped me learn how to containarize this app and use Docker compose to deploy this app in one command.

# How to run this app

You can simply clone the project first from github.
Then run `docker-compose up -d` to run the app.
And run `docker-compose down` to shut down the app cleanly!
